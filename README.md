# texty

## Project Description

The goal here is to build a text editor with some cool nifty features 
that uses the Tkinter GUI toolkit. The application is written from 
Bhaskar Chaudhary's book "Tkinter GUI Application Development 
Blueprints" (Chapter 2) and should work with Python 3.6+ and Tkinter 
8.6. Let's call it `texty`.

## Features

We intend to include the following features in the text editor:

* Create new documents
* Open and edit existing documents
* Save documents
* Implement common editing option: cut
* Implement common editing option: copy
* Implement common editing option: paste
* Implement common editing option: undo
* Implement common editing option: redo
* Search within a file for a given search term
* Implement line numbering and the ability to show/hide line numbers
* Implement theme selection to let a user choose custom color themes for 
the editor
* Implement the *About* and *Help* windows

## Prerequisites

Make sure to have installed:

* Python: v3.6+
* Tkinter: v8.6
